/**
 * The faces, and the guarantee that the first frame waits for them.
 *
 * FIX (the reference this kit is ported from gets this wrong): loading was
 * fired as a bare `void Promise.all(...)`, so nothing held the render back and
 * frames could composite before a face resolved — a still or the first frames
 * of a cut would ship in the fallback. `delayRender`/`continueRender` is the
 * only thing that makes typography deterministic.
 *
 * `bodyFamilyFor` is keyed by `Locale` on purpose. Adding a language to
 * `LOCALES` breaks THIS FILE until someone names a face for it, which is the
 * right place to be stopped: a face that covers latin can carry single
 * diacritics and silently drop the stacked ones another script is built from —
 * no missing-glyph box, just the wrong word. `fonts` in video.config.yaml is
 * the other half (`nv validate` reads each face's real cmap); the two must name
 * the same families.
