 * Scenes are registered on their own as well as inside each cut, so

 * isolation — the difference between scrubbing a two-minute timeline to reach
 * beat seven and just opening it.
 *
 * Only the default locale gets that treatment: they exist for checking layout,
 * and one more entry per scene per language would bury the compositions anyone
 * actually renders.
 *
 * `leadFrames` is passed through so an isolated scene is timed exactly as it is
 * in the cut. A standalone that started its reveals at 0 would look right on its
 * own and land early everywhere else.
