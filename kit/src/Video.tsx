/**
 * The cut: every scene, cross-faded, each with its own narration track.
 *
 * Audio is mounted per scene rather than as one track over the timeline, so a
 * line moves with its scene when the scene's length changes — which it does
 * every time the narration is re-synthesized, and again in every language.
 *
 * Two things here are corrections of the reference this kit is ported from, and
 * both are easy to undo by accident:
 *
 * 1. The <Audio> is inside `<Sequence from={leadFrames}>`, not at the scene's
 *    frame 0. A cross-fade overlaps two scenes; a line mounted at 0 therefore
 *    starts speaking while the PREVIOUS scene is still on screen. That survives
 *    review only because synthesized speech tends to open on a beat of near
 *    silence — it is wrong on every line, and audible on the ones that do not.
 * 2. The gate is `hasAudio` (does the mp3 exist on disk), not "is there a
 *    narration string". A project with a written script and no audio yet is the
 *    NORMAL state of a fresh clone with no API key: it must render silently,
 *    with the draft badge on, rather than abort on a missing asset.
