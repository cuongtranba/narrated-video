/**
 * Marks a cut whose scene lengths are guesses.
 *
 * A scene with no measured audio is timed from a character count — accurate to
 * roughly ±15%, fine for reviewing layout, wrong for anything anyone will
 * watch. There is no prop to turn this off and it renders in `remotion render`
 * exactly as it does in Studio, because a silent draft that LOOKS finished is
 * how a wrong cut ships: it leaves the machine looking like the real thing and
 * nobody downstream can tell. Run `nv voiceover` and it disappears on its own.
